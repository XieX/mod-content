The Ultimate Fist! Homage to a classic mod...

Kills (almost) anything with one hit! Destroys any block instantly! Based on the classic mod by IWANNAWIN, reproduced for Xie's Mod (without permission :3).

Installation
1. Install Xie's Mod if you haven't already
(http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/477267-v10-xies-mods/)
2. Copy the contents of this zip somewhere into ./mods/Xie/, I recommend the /content/ directory, or a subdirectory of it.

My recipe is slightly different, to be consistent with other tools,

DIAMOND DIAMOND DIAMOND
DIAMOND LEATHER DIAMOND
DIAMOND LEATHER DIAMOND

Also I made my own icon for the fist, not as good as the classic, because (as mentioned) it has been reproduced without permission :P

If you're a fan of the classic mod, I believe there is an updated version for MC 1.0.0:
