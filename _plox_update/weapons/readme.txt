Xie's Weapons Mod!
(for Xie's Mod Apr23 for Minecraft 1.2.5)

This mod demonstrates the newly added custom sword and bow features of Xie's Mod, introduced in version Apr23. It adds three new swords and three new bows.

Bone Sword (bone, bone, stick, sword pattern)
The bone sword is as durable as stone, but does as much damage as iron, and is as enchantable as wood.

Glass Sword (glass, glass, stick, sword pattern)
The glass sword does as much damage as a diamond sword, but is half as durable as a gold sword. It is nearly as enchantable as gold. An added disadvantage of the glass sword is its inability to block.

Blaze Sword (magma cream, magma cream, blaze rod, sword pattern)
The blaze rod sets target mobs on fire, as if it had the "Fire Aspect" enchantment. It deals as much damage as a diamond sword, and is as enchantable as wood. The drawback is it burns out quickly, having the same durability as wood.

Bone Bow (3 bone, 3 string, bow pattern)
The bone bow is less durable (only 131 uses), but it is significantly more enchantable than a normal bow.

Blaze Bow (3 blaze rods, 3 magma cream, bow pattern)
The blaze bow only has 100 uses, but it does not consume ammunition, and fires flame arrows!

Redstone Crossbow (3 gold ingots, 1 diamond, 3 redstone, pattern below)
The redstone crossbow is a powerful weapon, firing high-powered fully-automatic flaming arrows. It consumes redstone as ammunition. It is as durable as a normal bow. It's pattern is as follows:

GOLD   GOLD     ...
GOLD  DIAMOND REDSTONE
 ... REDSTONE REDSTONE
