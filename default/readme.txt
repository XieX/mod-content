Big thank you to everyone who has given be feedback. I'd like to especially think JT' for his excellent work on his Hardcore Default Content patch, which helped me to identify the worst of the inbalances, and provided some great ideas in general. Check out his patch at the wiki for an even greater survival challenge: http://xie.wikia.com/wiki/Hardcore_Default.
